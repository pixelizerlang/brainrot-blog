  <p>[You awaken.

Not gently, not peacefully — you awaken the way a corrupted mp4 tries to play on a potato laptop: jittery, half-rendered, reality buffering in at 3fps. Your eyes snap open to text burned into your skull:

Welcome to Nanotrasen’s SS13 Neuro-simulation.
Role: Assistant.
Objective: literally survive lol (ratio).

The HUD doesn’t even fade, it slides in with a CapCut transition. Airlock doors swish open in the arrivals bay and you’re immediately bombarded by audiovisual terrorism:

A clown barrels past on a segway, blasting “Skibidi Toilet” nightcore from a jury-rigged boombox, the hallway walls strobing with a “GYATT 💀💀” watermark someone coded into reality.

A security officer in full riot armor does a Sigma stare walk-cycle down the corridor while NPCs (actual human crewmates) play “Rizzler soundboard” clips over comms.

A botanist sprints out of hydroponics, holding what appears to be a glowing GMO banana that keeps yelling “WHAT THE SIGMA??” in distorted bass-boosted audio.

Your brain tries to parse the sensory overload. It fails. You take 3 SAN damage.

Stats (scuffed as hell):

Strength: 3 (you can lift a toolbox, but it’s giving Beta Male).

Dexterity: -2 (you keep pressing the wrong emote, default-dancing in front of the captain).

Intelligence: 1 (barely enough to understand wires aren’t food, but you might still eat them for the meme).

Luck: ??? (dependent on if the algorithm blesses you with a viral moment).

The tannoy crackles. The AI’s voice booms:

“Attention crew: due to low productivity, Fanum Tax is now doubled. Pay in food or perish.”

You hear someone scream in cargo: “NOT THE FANUM TAX AGAINNNNNN 😭😭😭”

Someone else: “Gyatt damn, who coded the AI like this?”

Meanwhile, your PDA buzzes. New message from Central Command:

“Reminder: station’s TikTok engagement rate is below 12%. Please produce more content.”

You close the PDA. Your eyes twitch. You understand now. This isn’t just a workplace simulator. It’s a content farm.

The round spirals instantly.

Medbay is running a Skibidi Toilet cult, dragging patients into cryo tubes to “be edited into the next episode.” Engineering has turned the singularity engine into a giant ring light. The clown, unholy and untouchable, is dual-wielding bike horns synced to “Grimace Shake edit” audio.

You stumble into the bar. Bartender’s slamming together cocktails like TikTok slime videos: bright, hyper-saturated, and deeply unsafe. He hands you a glass. The label reads:

Item: Brainrot Smoothie

Effect: +10 dopamine per sip

Side effect: permanent psychic echo of “ONLY IN OHIO 💀”

You drink it anyway.

Suddenly: a Syndicate agent approaches. Their voice glitch-shifts through TTS filters:

“Yo, slide me that ID and I’ll make you viral.”

They offer you an uplink disguised as a TikTok repost bot. Options flash across your HUD in flashing neon font:

[Buy Revolver 💥🔥 (Sound effect: “Skraaa! Pa-pa-pa-pa!”)]

[Buy C4 (captioned “This gonna be me fr when Ohio strikes”)]

[Buy Clown Car 🚗💨 (theme song auto-plays, bass boosted)]

[Decline (you will be edited into a Sigma Fail Compilation)]

The choice pulses at you. The crew is in meltdown. The algorithm demands sacrifice.

Somewhere in the distance, the station intercom plays distorted reverb:

“WHOLE LOTTA RED ALERT. WHOLE LOTTA RED ALERT.”]</p>
